# Bremen Internship 2025 â€“ MZH Building Evolution

This repository showcases a generative design study of the **MZH building** (University of Bremen), developed during the Summer Internship 2025.
It includes two parametric scripts that reflect the building's past and future architectural transformations, utilizing Blender Python scripting.

---

## Requirements

- [Blender 3.3.x] (https://www.blender.org/)
- PC or Laptop

---

## How to Use

1. Open Blender and load the MZH building model.
2. Go to the **Scripting tab**.
3. Open either `mzh-past.py` or `mzh-future.py`.
4. Run the script. It will procedurally modify the model:
    - `mzh-past.py`: Applies structural restoration or historical features.
    - `mzh-future.py`: Applies parametric curves, layered offsets, and wave-based forms.
